As we are wrapping up 2021H1 and heading to the long weekend, I wanna share some fun facts about the post stats in our group and a small suggestion (with caveats) on improving group engagement next half 🙂
FUN FACTS (SEE STATS. TABLE HERE)
Jiannan and Jessica posted most (24 posts) and Jiannan's post got most total comments&comments likes 😎
Richie got most total likes, about 100 likes with 20 posts!🤓
The most liked post is from Jiannan (14 likes) about a revenue hit and Ridwan about big bets sign-up from advertisers 🤩
Shutong has the highest likes-per-post, 7.2 likes per post, given total posts > 5 (correlation between tech-lead and likes-per-post? 🧐)
George prob. has the best "post performance" measured by h-index, ahh PM 😄 (h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact...)
DON'T BE SHY TO GIVE MORE LIKES
As a "not-so-great" comparison on post stats for CTMLG group vs. CTM group (both group have similar posts-per-group-member), CTMLG group has more comments per post (2.6) vs. CTM group (2.4) but CTMLG group has 20% lower likes-per-post (4.5) vs. CTM (5.7). So don't be shy to give more likes to each other's post and keep the engagement level high next half! 🥳
